            <p>In our society, there are a lot of people who did not get their daily needs. We should have helped those
                people. Poor people do not have enough clothing, food, education, and healthcare. Being poor means being
                deprived economically, politically, and socially.</p>

            <p class="text">There are plenty of people that take their homes and the amenities within them for granted.
                Not everyone gets to have a roof over their head every night or a bedroom all to themselves. For those
                of us who understand how fortunate we are, hearing that others go without things that we consider
                essentials is disconcerting at best and heart-wrenching at worst</p>

                <h2>Clothes for family</h2>
                <p> It should go without saying that some of the best items to donate to really help the homeless are
                    ones that protect them from the outside world. Exposure to the elements is a serious concern when
                    you don not have a place to live, especially if you live in an area with particularly harsh weather.
                    Cold weather clothing is a great donation to keep the people you are trying to help safe through
                    fall and winter</p>

                    Donations of nonperishable and unspoiled perishable food from homes and businesses help stock the
                    shelves at food banks, soup kitchens, pantries, and shelters.</p>
